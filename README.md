# Basic Custom Shaders

A Flutter project that shows how to work with basic custom shaders. The custom shaders are taken from [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) 
community and have been adapted to be used in a Flutter app.

[This article](https://cdmunoz.medium.com/custom-shaders-en-flutter-para-divertirse-un-rato-af131e9089c5) supports this repository and explains how it's implemented.

Feel free to star the repo or contribute with new custom shaders that use new variables such as mouse clicks or 
movements.
